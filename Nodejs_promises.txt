Promise by Bluebird is to address the issue of callback from function call.
1. Use case: Nested for loop to process an array of items before going to the next line of code to be executed.
Example: Without using Promise
var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
var index = 0;
for (index==0;index<cars.length;index++){
  cars[index] = cars[index] + '_updated';
}
console.log('Done');
