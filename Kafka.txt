Introdction on Kafka
--------------------
1. Kafka is organized around a few key terms: topics, producers, consumers, and brokers
2. Topics:
      All Kafka messages are organized into topics
      If you wish to send a message you send it to a specific topic and if you wish to read a message you read it from a specific topic.
3. Consumer:
      A consumer of topics pulls messages off of a Kafka topic.
4. Producers:
      Producers push messages into a Kafka topic.
5. Broker:
      Kafka, as a distributed system, runs in a cluster. Each node in the cluster is called a Kafka broker
